# Scraper

A list with the names of the sites to be scraped is in the websites.txt, one line per site.

A JSON file called data.json is the output with the desired data: logo, phones and site.

It's a work in progress. I can't finish it in time. 7 days. The main problem was scrap a website correctly. So many time I spent in this task.
